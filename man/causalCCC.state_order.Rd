\title{Create a state order file for causalCCC}
\usage{
causalCCC.state_order(
  mosaic_data_table,
  metadata_senders,
  metadata_receivers,
  genes_senders,
  ligands,
  receptors,
  genes_receivers
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mosaic_data_table}{[a data frame]
An output of causalCCC.mosaic()}

\item{metadata_senders}{[a named list] A named list of metadata (strings) with
levels as items. See exemple}

\item{metadata_receivers}{[a named list] A named list of metadata (strings) with
levels as items. See exemple}

\item{genes_senders}{[a vector] A list of selected genes (strings) for the
senders cells. Overlap with genes_receivers is not an issue}

\item{ligands}{[a vector] A list of selected CCC genes (strings) for the
senders cells. Overlap with genes_senders is not an issue}

\item{receptors}{[a vector] A list of selected CCC genes (strings) for the
receivers cells. Overlap with genes_receivers is not an issue}

\item{genes_receivers}{[a vector] A list of selected genes (strings) for the
receivers cells. Overlap with genes_senders is not an issue}
}
\value{
A state order that can be used for causalCCC
network reconstruction.
}
\description{
The state order is an mandatory file that allows you to input
optional information for the computation (such as contextual variables,
types of variables (otherwise detected automatically)... ) and information
for the display (groups of nodes, levels ordering of categorical data ...).

metadata <- list(
 treatment = c("Control", "Treated"),
