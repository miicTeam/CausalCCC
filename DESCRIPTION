Description: This repository contains the source code for CausalCCC, a method based on MIIC 
    (Multivariate Information based Inductive Causation) that learns a large class of causal or 
    non-causal graphical models from purely observational data while including the effects of 
    unobserved latent variables. Cell-Cell Communication (CCC) methods recover Ligand-Receptor 
    interactions between single cell populations, but do not usually integrate intracellular causal 
    pathways upstream and downstream of these L-R interactions. CausalCCC fills this gap by 
    providing an integrative online server to reconstruct gene-gene interaction pathways across 
    interacting cell types from single-cell transcriptomic data.
